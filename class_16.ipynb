    "in polynomial regression the set of independent variable which are allocated as x-data set (x-train,x-test) are first transformed using a method called as polynomial feature the tranform data is channeled to a linear regression algorithm to continue with the training and testing process.the stastical outcomes of complete implementation are the routine outcomes namely NSE, MAE and R2 score. \n",

    "Linear regression - It implements a parameter named as \"degree\". The value of this parameter can be tuned, with a final goal to obtain best performance transformed to be implemented for the machine learning algorithms (Linear regression). The tunning of the parameters manually or using automated system have to be evaluated for there final impact. be it one parameter or more than one parameter tunning may involve different permutation and combinations when it comes to multiple parameters kokl"
